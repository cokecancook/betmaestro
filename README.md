## üéØ Project Description

**BetMaestro** was created with a clear goal: to help users make better decisions in the world of sports betting. This project transforms data into value, automating the entire flow of ingestion, processing, and storage of sports information from different sources, and laying the foundation for future applications based on Artificial Intelligence.

---

## üß± Technical Architecture

The system is fully deployed on **Google Cloud Platform** and automated with **Terraform**.  
Our solution follows a modular and scalable approach, composed of:

üîπ **External APIs**  
Data obtained from [NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) and [SportsData.io](https://sportsdata.io/), including:

- Game statistics
- Betting odds
- Player injuries

üîπ **Cloud Functions**  
Python functions with different triggers:

- **Pub/Sub**: for real-time data processing
- **Cloud Storage**: for loading historical data from CSV

üîπ **Pub/Sub**  
Messaging system that decouples data producers and consumers.

üîπ **BigQuery**  
Analytical storage for massive processing and data exploration. Ready for use in AI models.

üîπ **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)**  
Relational database for storing structured information accessible to the backend.

üîπ **Cloud Run + Docker**  
Our internal APIs are also automatically deployed as containers.

üîπ **Streamlit**  
Interactive frontend to visualize insights and explore data easily and accessibly.

## ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence (Future Vision)

Although the current focus has been on building a solid infrastructure, BetMaestro is already prepared to be integrated with prediction models. Thanks to structured and automated storage, it is possible to develop:

- Prediction models for results or odds
- Real-time alert systems
- Personalized recommenders based on betting patterns

All this will be possible thanks to the quality and continuity of the data pipeline we have designed.

## üöÄ Deployment

Full deployment is completed in a few minutes with:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed
- Google Cloud Platform account and credentials configured (`gcloud auth application-default login`)
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Docker installed (for APIs and frontend)

### Deployment Structure

1. **Terraform**: Initializes and applies infrastructure in GCP (BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Storage)
2. **APIs and Cloud Functions**: Automatically deployed as containers and functions in GCP
3. **Streamlit**: Can be run locally or deployed as a container

### Example Deployment

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```
